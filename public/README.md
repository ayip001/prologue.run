# Public Assets

This folder contains static assets for the Next.js web application (prologue.run).

Place your logos, favicons, and other static files here. They will be served at the root URL path.

Example:
- `public/favicon.ico` → `https://prologue.run/favicon.ico`
- `public/logo.svg` → `https://prologue.run/logo.svg`

Note: This folder is for the web app only, not for the race-processor tool.
