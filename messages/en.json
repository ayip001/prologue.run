    "paragraph2": "Like many other runners, I enjoy running marathons outside of my hometown, and I sometimes just wish to see the route before running it (like reading the prologue for a book!). Then I noticed my 360 camera that's been gathering dust, and that's how this idea came to be.",
    "paragraph3": "Prologue.run allows you to preview the route of a race before you run it, like using Google Maps' Street View feature. Right now, the selection of races is limited to races that I have run, but I plan to add more races in the future as I complete more races. If you have a race that you would like to see on Prologue.run, or if you want to help log a race, please let me know by emailing me at"
