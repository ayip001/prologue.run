    "paragraph2": "Like many of you, I love traveling for marathons. But I often wished I could see the course before race day—just like reading the prologue of a book. One day, I looked at the 360° camera gathering dust on my shelf, and the idea clicked.",
    "paragraph3": "Prologue.run is essentially Street View for marathons. Currently, the library is limited to courses I've personally run, but I plan to expand it as I cross more finish lines. If there's a specific race you'd like to see, or if you want to contribute by logging a route yourself, hit me up at:"

        "a": "I'm building this catalog one race at a time, starting with my own journey to the 2026 HK Marathon. The library will grow as I (and the community) run more races."
      },
      "lookRidiculous": {
        "q": "Do you feel ridiculous running with that camera?",
        "a": "Absolutely. But hey, someone has to sacrifice their coolness so you can scout the course. You're welcome."
      },
      "lowQuality": {
        "q": "Why the image quality varies?",
        "a": "It depends heavily on the camera hardware and lighting conditions. Until I can run a marathon carrying a cinema rig, we're doing our best with consumer 360° cams."
      },
      "jankyControls": {
        "q": "Why isn't the viewer as smooth as Google Maps?",
        "a": "Google has thousands of engineers; Prologue has one. I built a custom rendering engine to make this possible on the web. It's constantly improving, so thanks for your patience."
      },
      "privacy": {
        "q": "How do you handle privacy (faces/plates)?",
        "a": "We use AI to automatically blur faces and license plates. If we missed something, let us know. If you want us to *unblur* your face... sorry, the answer is no."
      },
      "helpRecord": {
        "q": "Can I contribute a race route?",
        "a": "Yes! If you have a 360° camera and can record a full race, I'd love to host your route. Reach out, and I'll guide you through the process."
      },
      "getAnything": {
        "q": "Do I get paid for recording a race?",
        "a": "No cash, but you will unlock a massive 'sense of pride and accomplishment'. Plus, you'll get full credit on the race card forever."

        "q": "Can you add a specific feature?",

      "howItWorks": {
        "q": "How does the viewer work?",
        "a": "It projects equirectangular images onto a WebGL sphere. I had to build a custom viewer because existing libraries didn't fit my needs. It's homegrown code, but it gets the job done."
      },
      "isFree": {
        "q": "Is Prologue free?",
